\begin{abstract}
As software systems get more complex, the companies developing them consist of larger teams and therefore produce more complex communication artifacts.  As these software systems grow, so does the impact of every action to the product.  To find out how to prevent software failure created by this growth and complexity, companies need to find out more efficient and effective ways to communicate.  This paper provides an analysis of communications artifacts, linked to changesets by using multiple methods of textual analysis on the artifact, as well as the changeset.  These methods result in links that provide ways to analyze these communication artifacts and their participants to produce a historical representation in the form of networks, which can be used to software failures based on participants and communication.

\section{Introduction}

% Setup problem
Software failures are a bigger, more prevalent problem now than ever.  These failures can be catastrophic, causing billions of lost dollars, or even lives.  The main cause of these software failures is because the companies and products are larger than ever, and as a company and product grows in both size and complexity, the difficulty of developing high quality products is vastly increased.  One tactic companies employ to ease this is to make use of powerful communication and organization systems such as (BugZilla\footnote{http://bugzilla.org}, Jira\footnote{http://atlassian.com/software/jira/overview}, RTC\footnote{http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/products/rtc/}, etc.).  These systems provide bug reports and other communication artifacts, which are the core components implementing a software product during development, the importance of which has been researched by Timo Wolf et al\cite{?}, however they research at the build level, not changeset.  The impact of these communication artifacts on the project is massive, and any way to improve the impact or life-cycle of these communication artifacts is greatly desired.  Using social networks constructed from changesets, we study the participants and resultant snapshot of the project at that changeset to determine if there are harmful patterns of communication.  

% Other research 
Other researchers such as Bettenburg et al have done work to link communication artifacts to source code\cite{Bettenburg:2008:ESI:1370750.1370757}.  As well Sliwerski et al have tried to link fixes(changesets) to their corresponding bug reports\cite{Sliwerski:2005:CIF:1083142.1083147}.  These studies can assist us to understand the direct impact of the communication, and all the effected artifacts.

% Question
When companies use these systems, over time, there emerges patterns of communication that can be observed, and actioned upon.  These patterns are a result of the people involved in the communication artifacts at the given changeset.   So this causes us to ask the question: \textit{"Are there harmful communication patterns in social networks constructed from changesets?"}.  

% Method
This paper details our attempt at finding social networks at a changeset, and evaluating if any "harmful" communication patterns can be detected by  . These networks are useful for determining certain problematic groups of participants, or problem areas of a project that require more communication that another due to a more complex technical background, or steep learning curve. 

However, finding these patterns is non-trivial, and this study attempts to find out if harmful patterns of communication appear, and how to avoid them if so.


% reference this in our methodology section
% For analysis on bug reports and changesets to be relevant, first the fix-inducing changesets\cite{Sliwerski:2005:CIF:1083142.1083147} and their corresponding fixing changesets have to be determined.

The next step is to construct networks of communication between participants of the communications artifacts for each changeset.  Then, based on these per-changeset networks, analyze the patterns created and determine basic measures of quality.  Some of these being based on these links, making
